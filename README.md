## Re-install

A couple of weeks ago I cleaned up (delete+reinstall) my Macbook. I didn't back-up anything as I comitted myself to finally switch to VSC after having used Atom + Hyper terminal with custom configs. However, due to not wanting to spend too much time on my setup I took a look at the dotfiles of @dandevri, because I trust his taste.
